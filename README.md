## ⚡ Technical & Performance Features

- **Orthographic Camera**: Fixed angle looking down from south `(x, y + 26, z + 18)` focused on `(x, 0, z)` with dynamic aspect-ratio adaptation.
- **Strict Object Pooling**: Pre-allocated pools for 440 projectiles, 400 3D particle cubes, and 60 floating damage numbers with zero runtime mesh/geometry allocations in the animation loop.
- **Dynamic 2D Blood Decals**: Offscreen 1024x1024 2D canvas texture mapped onto the arena floor, throttled to at most one texture upload per frame and capped at 1,000 active splatters.
- **Flash Flat Shading**: Pure `MeshLambertMaterial` flat shading with `#111111` `EdgesGeometry` + `LineSegments` outlines on static obstacles.
- **Procedural Web Audio API**: 100% synthesized sound effects (gunshots, explosions, groans, chimes) with zero external asset dependencies.
- **2D Math & Physics**: Circle-circle, circle-AABB continuous collision resolution, and spatial grid partitioning for flocking separation.
